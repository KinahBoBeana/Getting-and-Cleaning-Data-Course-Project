CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R follows the 5 steps required as described in the course project's definition:

- merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

FineData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
